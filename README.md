# Introduction

<i>Zi-RTOS</i> is a Cooperative multitasking or in other words it is a <b> non-preemptive multitasking </b> RTOS. Cooperative RTOSs are a style of computer multitasking in which the operating system never initiates a context switch from a running process to another process. Instead, in order to run multiple applications concurrently, processes voluntarily yield control periodically or when idle or logically blocked. This type of multitasking is called cooperative because all programs must cooperate for the scheduling scheme to work. for more information about Cooperative-RTOS refer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking)
